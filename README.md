# N-Length-Nodes
This program finds all paths of length N there are in a given undirected graph from A to B, and displays each unique path. This was my parallel computing program for Structure Computing Organization at FIU

## Running the Program
##### ./N-Length-Nodes
- -t: print time only
- -d: default count to 10, path to 2
- -g: preform calculations on GPU only
- -s: show paths
- -c [num of nodes]
- -p [num of paths]
- -a [start node number (0 to c-1)]
- -b [end node number (0 to c-1)]
